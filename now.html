  Currently pondering the quality of connections made on social media platforms...
</p>


<h2>Thoughts</h2>

  <ul>
      <li>The word "connect/connection" seems overused on social media, or at the very least, it seems to me that 
          the kind of connection that is possible through comment sections and sharing of posts is often superficial at best. </li>
         <ul>
         <li>I want more than this, which will be a work in progress, but I have done harder things than quitting social media </li>
         </ul>
      <li>Navigating nuance is complicated in short-form content</li>
         <ul>
         <li>It is further complicated by the assumptions of strangers</li>
         </ul>
  </ul>
