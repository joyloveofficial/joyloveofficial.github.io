  <h1>Joy Love</h1>

  <p></p>

<p>
  This website is a <em>digital garden</em> — a space for freely thinking,
 growing, creating, and generally existing outside of the reach of attention-harvesting algorithms and profit motive.
</p>

  <p>
    Unlike a traditional portfolio, a digital garden is not organized by
    finished outcomes; it is alive, and like all living things, it may change without notice. 
    Pages here are connected, revisited, and allowed to
    remain incomplete.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is my digital garden; you are welcome to wander.
