<p>
  Currently pondering the quality of connections made on social media platforms.

  Conclusions drawn so far:
   - "Connection" is overused on social media, or at the very least, the kind of connection that is possible through comment sections and sharing of posts is often superficial at best.
         - I want more than this, which will be a work in progress, but I have done harder things than quitting social media
   - Navigating nuance is complicated in short-form content
         - It is further complicated by the assumptions of strangers
