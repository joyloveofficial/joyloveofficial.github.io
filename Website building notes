A Helpful Way to Learn Going Forward
When you see CSS, ask:

- What is the resting state?
- What changes on interaction?
- How does it get from one to the other?

If you can answer those three, you understand the code.

A Garden Metaphor (If Helpful)

<p> = soil (ideas grow here)
<ul> = a bed
<li> = individual plants

Each has a role.

One Last Useful Tip
If you ever wonder:

“Which tag should I use?”

Ask:
Is this a thought? → <p>
Is this a group of things? → <ul>
Is this one thing in that group? → <li>

That mental model will carry you far.

“Wandering” Links (This Is Subtle but Important)
In a digital garden, links should feel like:
  “You could go here next, if you want.”

Not:
  “CLICK THIS TO PROCEED.”

Pattern A: Contextual Linking (Primary)
Instead of navigation bars, use sentences:

<p>
  This work connects to ongoing questions about
  <a href="notes/materials.html">materials</a> and
  <a href="notes/process.html">process</a>.
</p>

This feels like thinking, not menuing.

Pattern B: Soft “Back” Links
At the bottom of pages, use gentle exits:

<p class="back-link">
  ← <a href="garden.html">return to the map</a>
</p>

Avoid:
“Home”
“Main menu”
     Words matter here.

---

Quiet Disclaimer Footer (Signals Intentional Unfinishedness)
At the bottom of notes pages (later) or even the garden index, add:

<p class="note-meta">
  This is a living document. It may change without notice.
</p>

This:
protects you from perfectionism
reframes incompleteness as practice
signals confidence
