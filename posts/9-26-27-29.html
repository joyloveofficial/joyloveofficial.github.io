Macs Coke slushies on Whyte
taste like corporate speak- cold and a little bit overly sweet
but at least school’s out, though not really
so I listen for the whispers of fluttering leaves, as my
inked shoulders burn red on the
smell of yesterday's Beercade vomit on the street and

I am one of Them

I walk slowly
and tug on this olive wool sweater gleefully for the
crisp, cool, and the damp leaves I
wade through those crackling yellow oceans breathing
deep the pungent sunset of decay and him
warming my tongue like an Earl Grey
tea –leaving my palms a bit sweaty– because His fingers are woven in 
  with mine, and good god, I must be

one of Them...

mesmerized by the valley of the prisms of ice
and stung by the Beaver Hills special –fucking polar vortex frostbite
devouring every manner of carbohydrate under
the hushed blankets of snow white nights I
eat shit– slip but do not hit the ground of course
worry not, I was raised here on the ice so I 
know how to catch my balance because

I am home here

<pre>
sat on some shimmering, damp, dead lawn
revelling in a familiar birdsong and
blinded by the glisten of first dewdrops, I
pull my hoodie off– today it is the best kind of zero degrees, so
I inhale deeply- the green air of this
expanse of impossibly bright blue skies and
to the screaming mass of iridescent Magpies meeting overhead 
  in the elms

I am only another one of 
Them
